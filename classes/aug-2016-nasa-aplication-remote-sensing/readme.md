##### Slide Notes

##### **S**oil **M**oisture **A**ctive **P**assive

* **Passive Sensor** - The source of radiant energy arising from natural sources
* **Active Sensor** - Provide their own source of radiant energy

* **Microwave Remote Sensing** - Can penetrate clouds and work at night because of the frequency at which the wave travels
    - Microwaves can penetrate through clouds and vegetation, operate day and night, and are highly sensitive to the water in the soil due to the change in the soil 

* **Soil Moisture (SM)** - Measured by SMAP
    - For each kg of water on the earth, 1mg is stored in the soil
    - Soil moisture varies with space and time
    - **SMAP** - Measure the moisture in the top 5 cm of the soil globally every 3 days
        + 10-40 km spatial resolution
        + 3 day global revisit
        + Accuracy of 0.04m3/m3

* **Evapotranspiration (ET)** -
