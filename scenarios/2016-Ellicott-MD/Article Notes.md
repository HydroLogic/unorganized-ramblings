* [Baltimore Sun - After deadly flash flood, concern about development’s impact on Ellicott City](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/ellicott-city/bs-md-ho-ellicott-city-development-20160813-story.html) accessed 8/29/2016

  '''Ten years ago, the Chesapeake Bay Trust determined that about 28 percent of the Tiber‐Hudson "sub-watershed," about 3 square miles, was covered by these hard surfaces — and predicted that proportion would reach nearly 32 percent as builders continued construction in the area.'''

  '''During the flash flood, a water retention pond near the Hudson tributary at Burgess Mill Station — 198 new apartments — burst under intense pressure.'''

  '''Some of Ellicott City's most destructive floods — the Great Flood of 1868 that killed 43 people and Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972 — caused extensive damage after the Patapsco swelled from heavy rains.'''

  '''Howard County, as well as the other nine largest Maryland jurisdictions, must reduce impervious surfaces by 20 percent as part of a federal mandate and Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts.'''
